    "\"\"\"Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\"\"\"\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of information. It provides a mechanism to store, manage, and retrieve data for various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "#SQL DATABASE:\n",
    "    1.SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on the relational model.\n",
    "    2.They use tables to store data, with each table consisting of rows and columns.\n",
    "    3.The data is organized into predefined structures with a fixed schema.\n",
    "    4.SQL databases enforce ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "    5.SQL databases enforce ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "#NOSQL DATABASE:\n",
    "    1.SQL databases enforce ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "    2.They provide flexible schemas, allowing for dynamic and schema-less data.\n",
    "    3.NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning they can handle large amounts of data distributed across multiple servers.\n",
    "    4.NoSQL databases sacrifice some ACID properties (e.g., consistency) in favor of performance and scalability.\n",
    "    5.Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB."
