    "how each measure can be used to describe a dataset. \"\"\"\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    " * Mean: \n",
    "    The mean is the average value of a dataset. It is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the \n",
    "    total number of observations.\n",
    "    The mean represents the typical or average value in the dataset. \n",
    "    It is sensitive to outliers since extreme values can heavily influence its value.\n",
    "    \n",
    " * Median: \n",
    "    The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "    If the dataset has an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value. \n",
    "    If the dataset has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values. \n",
    "    The median is robust to outliers and provides a measure of central tendency that is less affected by \n",
    "    extreme values.\n",
    "    \n",
    " * Mode: \n",
    "    The mode is the value or values that appear most frequently in a dataset. \n",
    "    It represents the most common observation(s) in the dataset.\n",
    "    Unlike the mean and median, the mode can be applied to both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    " * Range:\n",
    "    The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "    It provides a simple measure of the spread of the data.\n",
    "    However, it only considers the extreme values and does not account for the distribution of the remaining values.\n",
    "    \n",
    " * Variance:\n",
    "    Variance measures the average squared deviation of each value from the mean.\n",
    "    It provides a measure of the dispersion of the data. A higher variance indicates greater variability in\n",
    "    the dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    " * Standard Deviation: \n",
    "    The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average deviation of each value\n",
    "    from the mean. \n",
    "    It provides a more interpretable measure of dispersion compared to the variance since it is expressed in \n",
    "    the same units as the original data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "These measures of central tendency and variability are used to describe and summarize datasets.\n",
    "Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) provide insights into the typical or representative values \n",
    "in the data.\n",
    "They help us understand the central value around which the data tends to cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation) describe the spread or dispersion of the data. \n",
    "They indicate the extent to which the values deviate from the central tendency. \n",
    "They provide information about the consistency or variability of the dataset, allowing us to assess the degree\n",
    "of spread or dispersion among the values."
